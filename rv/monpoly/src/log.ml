(* It seems we have:

     curr_p.pos_cnum = abs_pos + curr_pos

   [abs_pos] seems to be an absolute position in the stream
   (unless [flush_input] has been called...)

   [start_pos] and [curr_pos] are relative positions (within
   [lex_buffer]) and delimit the current lexeme

   See also lexing.ml

   We could also try to mark the character [cnum] as in:
     line prefix  current token  rest of line
                                ^

   Note that the returned [line] omits the prefix if the current token
   is not at the beginning of the line.
