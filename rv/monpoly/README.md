# Monpoly

MonPoly is a prototype monitoring tool that checks compliance of log files with respect to policies specified by formulas in MFOTL (Metric First-Order Temporal Logic).

An overview of the tool, including its usage and history, can be found in this [paper](https://sourceforge.net/projects/monpoly/files/monpoly.pdf/download).

The tool is developed as part of an academic project at ETH Zurich. For more details on the project please visit [this link](http://www.infsec.ethz.ch/research/projects/mon_enf).
