        "\nHeteroCL Tutorial : CORDIC Design\n=================================\n\n**Author**: Yi-Hsiang Lai (seanlatias@github)\n\nCOordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC) is a method for calculating a\nvariety of functions including trigonometric and hyperbolic. The various\nfunctions are calculated through an iterative set of vector rotations. At the\nend of these rotations, the value of the function is easily determined from\nthe (x, y) coordinate. A CORDIC is often used to achieve low-cost\nmultiplierless sine/cosine implementations in FPGA as well as ASIC designs.\n\nIn this tutorial, we demonstrate how to make use of the decoupled quantization\nschemes and algorithms in HeteroCL. We also show how we can explore different\nquantization schemes with the quantize API.\n"
